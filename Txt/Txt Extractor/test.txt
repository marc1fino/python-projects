- Adventure of a Lifetime by Coldplay

	Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
	Everything you want's a dream away
	We are legends, every day
	That's what she told him
	Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
	Everything you want's a dream away
	Under this pressure, under this weight
	We are diamonds
	Now I feel my heart beating
	I feel my heart beneath my skin
	I feel my heart beating
	Oh, you make me feel
	Like I'm alive again
	Alive again
	Oh, you make me feel
	Like I'm alive again
	Said I can't go on, not in this way
	I'm a dream that died by light of day
	Gonna hold up half the sky and say
	Only I own me
	Now I feel my heart beating
	I feel my heart beneath my skin
	Oh, I can feel my heart beating
	'Cause you make me feel
	Like I'm alive again
	Alive again
	Oh, you make me feel
	Like I'm alive again
	Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
	Everything you want's a dream away
	Under this pressure, under this weight
	We are diamonds taking shape
	We are diamonds taking shape
	(Woo-ooh, woo-ooh)
	If we've only got this life
	This adventure, oh then I
	And if we've only got this life
	You'll get me through, oh
	And if we've only got this life
	And this adventure, oh then I
	Wanna share it with you
	With you, with you
	Sing it, oh, say yeah
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
	Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
